User groups in San Andres Island (SAI) are ethnically divided: artisanal fishers are natives, while non-natives (migrants from mainland Colombia who mainly arrived after 1960 and their descendants) run tourism and watersports enterprises. In Old Providence and Santa Catalina (OPSC), natives control all stakeholder groups. After completing the inventory, a meeting was held with the groups. Because of the ethnic tension between stakeholders in SAI, this meeting was acrimonious. The level of distrust between natives and resident continentals made productive exchange impossible. Some of the hostility stemmed from different languages and social customs, making it even harder for these groups to communicate.

FARMC is a multisectoral group of fishers, people’s organizations (POS), non-government organizations (NGOs) and government agencies that regulates resource use in the name of all stakeholders. Fishery problems are initially presented, deliberated, and resolved at the FARMC. The local government and the fishers work closely through a series of general assemblies, discussions, and consensus building to arrive at solutions suitable to the community [from background section]: Enabling legislation, particularly the 1991 Local GovernmentCode (LGC)and the 1995Executive Order (EO) 240, creating a Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Management Council (FARMC) in every coastal barangay (village), municipality or city, has provided the institutional setting for the emergence and enhancement of fisheries co- management at the village level (Sunderlin and Gorospe, 1997).The FARMC has been mandated to be composed of 75% fishers.

This was earlier demonstrated by the fishers’ collective action to end the fishery concession and to form their own group to increase fish catch. A catalyst, however, was needed to redirect these efforts towards a more positive and sustainable use of fishery resources.

The interdisciplinaryproject team encountered problems in the initial phase of project implementation (Agbayani and Siar, 1994). Village fishers expected immediate benefits. SEAFDEC AQDs research and community organizing activities were not attuned to each other. Most community members did not appreciate or understand research. There was no full-time project leader. Also, the Fishermen’s Association of Malalison Island (FAMI) had leadership problems.
